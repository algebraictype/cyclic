In algebra, a  [cylic group](wikiedia.com/cyclic_group) or monogenous group is a group, denoted C_n that is generated by a single element.

**cylic** was an idea that originally stemmed from my writing of a mathematical paper concerning a set of equivalent mappings that is generated by the sum of two natural numbers. The purely mathematical pondering led me to a more computational questioning after thinking about my mathematical paper's implications in computing. I posed a question to myself which prompted my ideation of **cyclic**: "is a programming language centered around the usage of the principal of group cyclicality, and a neutrally defined identity element in a cyclic group, possible?" 

This is when I decided to write a small esolang and compiler to accompany the grammar, thus **cyclic** was born.

This compiler, and programming language, are still in their very early stages of development. Currently, the compiler exists just as the frontend of a compiler, but I have many planned features that are not yet implemented. The language is still in its infancy, and I am still working on the grammar and the semantics of the language. I am also working on the backend of the compiler, which will be written in C++.



**Installation**
---

You may either build **cyclic** from source, or simply download the binary provided in this repository:

1.) To build **cyclic**
```bash
#Create build directory
mkdir cyclic
#Clone the repository
git clone https://www.github.com/algebraictype/cyclic
#Build the compiler (you may pass -nogtest to compile without Google Test)
make
```

2.) Download binary from releases tab

You will now have the **cyclic** compiler in the directory you created in the first step of the installation instructions.
